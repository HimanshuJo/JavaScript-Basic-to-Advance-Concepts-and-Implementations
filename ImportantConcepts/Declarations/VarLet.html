<!--
var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript 
but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. 

It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let. 

An example will clarify the difference even better:

	Example of var:

		Input:
		console.log(x);
		var x=5;
		console.log(x);

		Output:
		undefined
		5

	-------

	Example of let:

		Input:
		console.log(x);
		let x=5;
		console.log(x);

		Output:
		Error

<!--
In the following code, clicking start will call a function that changes the color of the 
two headings every 0.5sec. 

The color of first heading is stored in a var and the second one is declared by using let. 

Both of them are then accessed outside the function block. 

	Var will work but the variable declared using let will show an error because let is block scoped
