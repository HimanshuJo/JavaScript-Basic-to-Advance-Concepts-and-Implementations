What is a map in JavaScript?

	Map is a data structure in JavaScript which allows storing of [key, value] 
	pairs where any value can be either used as a key or value.

	The keys and values in the map collection may be of any type and if a value is 
	added to the map collection using a key which already exists in the collection, 
	then the new value replaces the old value.

	The iteration of elements in a map object is done in the insertion order and a 
	“for…” loop returns an array of all [key, value] pairs for each iteration.

-------

Differences between Objects and Maps in JavaScript:

	Both of these data structures are similar in many ways such as both store values using keys, 
	allow retrieval of those values using keys, deletion of keys and verify whether a key 
	holds any value or not. 

	However, there are quite significant differences between Objects and Maps in JavaScript
	which make the usage of maps a better and more preferable option in many cases.

	Map:

		The keys used in maps can be any type of values such as functions, objects etc

		The size of a map can be known easily by using the size property

		A Map should be preferred in cases where the requirement involves 
		frequent addition and removal of [key, value] pairs because a map is an 
		iterative data type and can be directly iterated

	Objects:

		The keys in objects are limited to symbols and strings

		While dealing with objects, the size has to be determined manually.

		Iterating an object requires obtaining its keys in a specific manner.

Map.has() Method in JavaScript:

	The Map.has() method in JavaScript is used to check whether an element with a 
	specified key exists in a map or not. 

	It returns a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of an element with a specified key in a map.

	The Map.has() method takes the key of the element to be searched as an argument and 
	returns a boolean value. 

	It returns true if the element exists in the map else it 
	returns false if the element doesn’t exist.

-------

Applications:

	Map.has() Method can be used to check whether an element with a specified key exists in a map or not.

Syntax:

	mapObj.has(key)

Parameters Used:

	key: It is the key of the element of the map which has to be searched.

Return Value:

	The Map.has() method returns a boolean value. 

	It returns true if the element exists in the map else it returns false if the element doesn’t exist.

-------

Examples:

	Input : var myMap = new Map();
	        myMap.set(0, 'geeksforgeeks');
	        console.log(myMap.has(0));
	        
	Output: true

	Explanation: 

		In this example, a map object “myMap” has been created with a single [key, value] 
		pair and the Map.has() method is used to check whether an element with the key ‘0’ exists in the map or not.
	
	-------

	Input : var myMap = new Map();
	        myMap.set(0, 'geeksforgeeks');
	        myMap.set(1, 'is an online portal');
	        myMap.set(2, 'for geeks');
	        console.log(myMap.has(0));
	        console.log(myMap.has(3));

	Output: true
	        false

	Explanation: 

		In this example, a map object “myMap” has been created with three [key, value] pairs and the 
		Map.has() method is used to check whether an element with the key ‘0’ and ‘3’ exists in the map or not.
