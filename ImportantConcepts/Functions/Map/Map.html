<!--
The Map.get() method in JavaScript is used for returning a specific element 
among all the elements which are present in a map. 

The Map.get() method takes the key of the element to be returned as an argument and 
returns the element which is associated with the specified key passed as an argument. 

If the key passed as an argument is not present in the map, then Map.get() method returns undefined. 

The Map.get() method is used to get a specific element among all the elements which are present in a map.

-------

Syntax:

	mapObj.get(key)

Parameter Value:

	key: It is the key of the element of the map which has to be returned.

Return Value: 

	The Map.get() method returns the element which is associated with the specified key 
	passed as an argument or undefined if the key passed as an argument is not present in the map.

-------

The examples below illustrate the get() method:

Example 1: 

	This example describes the Map() method to create the map object that contains the 
	[key, value] pair to the map & displays the element that is associated with the specific 
	key using the Map.get() method.

<!--
	Differences between Objects and Maps in JavaScript: 

		Both of these data structures are similar in many ways such as 
		both are used to store values using keys, allowing retrieval of those values using 
		keys, deletion of keys, and verifying whether a key holds any value or not. 

		However, there are quite significant differences between Objects and Maps in JavaScript 
		which make the usage of maps a better and more preferable option in many cases.

		Map:

			The keys used in maps can be any type of values such as functions, objects etc

			The size of a map can be known easily by using the size property

			A Map should be preferred in cases where the requirement involves 
			frequent addition and removal of [key, value] pairs because a map is an 
			iterative data type and can be directly iterated

		Objects:

			The keys in objects are limited to symbols and strings

			While dealing with objects, the size has to be determined manually.

			Iterating an object requires obtaining its keys in a specific manner.
-->

<!--
	Exceptions:

	If the variable is not of the Map type then the Map.get() operation throws a TypeError.

	If the index specified in the Map.get() function doesnâ€™t belong to the 
	[key, value] pairs of a map, the Map.get() function returns undefined.
