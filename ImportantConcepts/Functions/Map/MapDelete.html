What is a map in JavaScript?

	Map is a data structure in JavaScript which allows storing of [key, value] 
	pairs where any value can be either used as a key or value.

	The keys and values in the map collection may be of any type and if a value is 
	added to the map collection using a key which already exists in the collection, 
	then the new value replaces the old value.

	The iteration of elements in a map object is done in the insertion order and a 
	“for…” loop returns an array of all [key, value] pairs for each iteration.

-------

Differences between Objects and Maps in JavaScript:

	Both of these data structures are similar in many ways such as both store values using keys, 
	allow retrieval of those values using keys, deletion of keys and verify whether a key 
	holds any value or not. 

	However, there are quite significant differences between Objects and Maps in JavaScript
	which make the usage of maps a better and more preferable option in many cases.

	Map:

		The keys used in maps can be any type of values such as functions, objects etc

		The size of a map can be known easily by using the size property

		A Map should be preferred in cases where the requirement involves 
		frequent addition and removal of [key, value] pairs because a map is an 
		iterative data type and can be directly iterated

	Objects:

		The keys in objects are limited to symbols and strings

		While dealing with objects, the size has to be determined manually.

		Iterating an object requires obtaining its keys in a specific manner.

Map.delete() Method in JavaScript

	The Map.delete() method in JavaScript is used to delete the specified element 
	among all the elements which are present in the map.

	The Map.delete() method takes the key which needs to be removed from the map, 
	thus removes the element associated with that key and returns true. 

	If the key is not present then it returns false.

	Applications:

		Map.delete() is used to delete an element associated with the key among all 
		the elements present in the map.
	
	Syntax:

		my_map.delete(key)

	Parameters Used:

		key: The element associated with this key is to be removed from the map
	
	Return value:

		The Map.delete() method returns true, if the key is present whose associated element 
		is to removed which is passed as an argument, otherwise returns false.

-------

Examples:

Input :  my_map.set(1, 'first');
         my_map.set(2, 'second');
         my_map.set(3,'third');
         my_map.set(4,'fourth');

         document.write(my_map.delete(3));

Output : true

Explanation: The key ‘3’ is present in the map hence element associated with it is removed and return true

-------

Input :  my_map.set(1, 'first');
         my_map.set(2, 'second');
         my_map.set(3,'third');
         my_map.set(4,'fourth');
   
         document.write(my_map.delete(5));

Output : false

Explanation: The key ‘5’ is not present in the map hence it returns false.

-------

Error and Exception:

	If the key passed as an argument to the function is not present in the map then it returns false. 

	Basically, it neither throws any exception nor does it have any error.
	
	Difference in working of Map.clear(), Map.erase() and this function
	
	Map.clear() removes all key-value pairs of the map and reduces the size of the map to zero. 

	Whereas Map.erase() removes the specified mapped value whose key is passed as an argument or 
	iterator or in range to remove pairs.
